## Exploit
The most stupid test was successful:
- In the message field input: `<script>alert(1);</script>`
- The flag just pop.

**Flag:**

## Prevention
- [Cross Site Scripting (XSS) | OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)
    - [Cross Site Scripting Prevention - OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- [CWE - CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (4.13)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

XSS is a type of vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages.
Three main types of XSS vulnerabilities:
- **Reflected XSS**: Injected into the website's response.
- **Stored XSS**: Malicious script is stored on the server and then served to all the website users.
- **DOM-based XSS**: Occurs entirely on the user's browser rather than on the server. The payload is never sent to the server

In this case it would be a Stored XSS because the comment is stored and then served to all the users.

### How to prevent
- Modern web frameworks have fewer XSS bugs:
    - React Example: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` should be explicitely used to be vulnerable
- Implement variable validation and/or sanitization
- Output encoding: variables should not be interpreted as code instead of text.
    - When you wish to display data as the user typed it in, start with your frameworkâ€™s default output encoding protection.
- HTML Sanitization: will strip dangerous HTML from a variable and return a safe string.
